# insight in the mini-project

Hello, welcome to another project of mine, where I am measuring certain assets within the S&P 500 to determine their Global minimum portfolios, efficient portfolios, the frontier of said assets, and finally the tangency portfolio, under certain conditions. 

It is important to keep in consideration the R files that store the functions needed to perform these measurements. 
I chose certain stocks I would consider volatile, steady growing, and consistently in media and impacted by the measurements of the economic behavior of America. 

All sets were imported from a CSV I manually created, where I took the ADJ closing price from yahoo finance, which is downloaded from their historical finance data section.

If you have any pull requests, questions, or any type of concerns, please reach out to me!

Enjoy some R-code :)
